# Homework 10

Homework was straightforward and the code in `bmap()` is pretty self explanatory so I don't feel that any additional explanation is necessary. As evidence that the code worked, I'm including the `xv6` output after running `big`.

```
cpu0: starting
init: starting sh
$ big
.....................................................................................................................................................................
wrote 16523 sectors
done; ok
```
